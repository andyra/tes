Alice Invuliavek is the "voice of the skyscraper" at [The Adobe Skyscraper]. She voices important information over the building-wide intercom system such as daily menus, elevator times, and concerns about the lights going on and off. Her voice has been seen by some to be so soothing that they purchased recordings of her giving announcements to listen to in order to relax. She also is responsible for telling people they are fired.
