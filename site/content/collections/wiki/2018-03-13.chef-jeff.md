Chef Jeff is a Master Cereal Chef and the Chief Chef of [Mr. Capestrano]. He specialized in [Lixx cereal]. At one point he was involved in overseeing many Lixx plantations and the rabble that worked them, until these operations were shut down by Mr. Capestrano for being too risky and attracting too much negative attention. He also focuses on cooking small quantities in small confines with small ingredients, due to the fact that he is so small. He has his own show, [Chef Jeff's Cooking Closet].
