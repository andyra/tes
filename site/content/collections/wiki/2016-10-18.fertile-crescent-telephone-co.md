    text: '<p>The Fertile Crescent Telephone Company is a telecommunications center/recording studio in the heart of <a href="{{ link:5d2b95f8-0372-4557-a97c-c3c40d7a2f9e }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>. The telecom division deals exclusively in land-line telephone technology, including (but not limited to) corded and wireless phone systems, answering machines, fax machines, trans-causeway friendship relays, remote buffeting transceivers, and transistor-based signal generators. The service area currently extends over the city of <a href="{{ link:20e35b3a-534f-42e6-a402-597d774ecc5a }}">Adobe Skyscraper</a>, <a href="{{ link:3e664a00-7574-44aa-970b-fff26a06d4f4 }}">Monorail City</a>, and surrounding area. Headway is currently being made into extending service to rural parts of <a href="{{ link:8e2e83ac-f973-459a-abea-bc00b2a7e441 }}">Wonderful Land</a>&nbsp;and <a href="{{ link:97cbcb3e-2a24-404f-8b95-9a46d7f18e1e }}">unincorporated territory</a>..</p><h2>Recording Studio</h2><p>Although primarily a telecom center, F. C. Telco has seen recent success in the development of a recording studio in the remains of the customer support office. The support program was put on hold by <a href="{{ link:0361ef61-5370-44a1-bab3-25ba31271a26 }}">Ray Wister</a> in April 1988 due to an influx of calls from unsatisfied customers after an especially violent lightning storm. The extra time Ray gained in avoiding his job allowed him to look for musicians living in and around the largely unexplored areas of Wonderful Land. Early recording sessions were made almost exclusively with modified land line phone technology, including the use of a massive ~3600 mile-long subterranean cable to record a drum solo.</p><h2>Studio Personnel</h2><ul><li><a href="{{ link:0361ef61-5370-44a1-bab3-25ba31271a26 }}">Ray Wister</a>: Producer, Booking</li><li><a href="{{ link:a062f987-9889-47ed-903d-50db01218fc1 }}">Suzi Ochikubo</a>: Principle Technician &amp; Mastering Engineer</li><li><a href="{{ link:342126fb-4cea-48ba-932d-1c795815af6c }}">Mel Fairlight</a>: Recording Engineer</li><li><a href="{{ link:84f21787-8ae1-4668-85f5-57b2cdde150b }}">Lmo Kodak</a>: Studio Director / Owner<br></li></ul>'
