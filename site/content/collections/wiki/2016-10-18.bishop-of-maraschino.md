The Bishop of Maraschino lives in [Sohndu Bay] and oversees the well-being of the people in that area. He mostly spends his time sending out questionnaires regarding people's overall happiness factor and administering 11 different soup kitchens in Sondhu Bay's rural downtown. He was harassed for years by the enigmatic potentate, [King James], which culminated in the War of the Trees.

The Bishop also famously mentored [Rector Kerby], the famous child celebrity cleric of the [Sondhu Bay Transcendentalist Union].
