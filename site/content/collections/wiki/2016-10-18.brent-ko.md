Brent Ko is an entrepreneur who owns and operates [Solar Jail] and [Sports Tree]. He has capitalized on utilizing natural resources (such as the sun and the serengetis trivium) as the basis for his businesses. He has no formal business training, but his ultra low overhead and minimal employees allows for him to make exceeding profits. When not personally managing Sports Tree, he is usually travelling to entrepreneurial conferences to give workshop speeches, usually on the topic of "Open Your Eyes." He wears a trademark top hat and has an indoor swimming pool designed to look like a rain forest pond.
