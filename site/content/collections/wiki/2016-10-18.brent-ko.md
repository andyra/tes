He has no formal business training, but his ultra low overhead and minimal employees allows for him to make exceeding profits. When not personally managing Sports Tree, he is usually traveling to entrepreneurial conferences to give workshop speeches, usually on the topic of "Open Your Eyes." He wears a trademark top hat and has an indoor swimming pool designed to look like a rain forest pond.</p>'
