Emily Plantana is the director of the the underground aquarium at [The Adobe Skyscraper]. She received her degree in marine biology from [Librari University] and her PhD from [Jon Paul Jones School of Water and Music] where she did her dissertation on the nocturnalization of marine fauna.

When the [Underground Aquarium] was initially opened, many of the creatures would sleep constantly due to being completely underground. Dr. Plantana was able to modify the diet and sonic environment to encourage more natural behavior, and consequently helped usher in a dearth of new behavioral species.

Dr. Plantana often takes community groups on animal spotting tours of [Lovely Lake] and the [Uluwehi River] to help the public learn about beautiful and dangerous marine animals.
