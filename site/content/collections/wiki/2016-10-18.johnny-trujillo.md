Johnny “Knuckle Sandwich” Trujillo operates [Mr. Capestrano]’s limousine rental service, and he occasionally roughs people up who return the limousines in less than pristine condition. Actually, he likes to try and intercept the limousine renters and punch them in the nose, causing them to bleed on the back seat, resulting in a cleaning fine at turn-in.
