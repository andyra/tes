    text: '<p>K.C. Neutron Roller is the skating rink and color experience garden on the roof level of <a href="{{ link:5d2b95f8-0372-4557-a97c-c3c40d7a2f9e }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>. It combines the popular skating music of the day with a color combination experience produced by various lasers, colorchalk, and diode lightrods. Occasionally, the roof will be retracted and a starlight skate will be made available.</p><p>The surface of the Neutron Roller is actually a piece of an old neutron shield that was donated by the Science Department at <a href="{{ link:51ed25da-27a7-46c9-a10b-70bddafb1e34 }}">Adobe College of the Desert</a>. The color combination experiences are provided by trained technicians, such as <a href="{{ link:4b88b26f-c153-4bb6-81d8-b3f14e253565 }}">Lana Greensage</a>. In 1998, K.C. Neutron Roller entered into a Joint Operating Agreement with <a href="{{ link:0cfadc11-c1ca-40dc-9cc0-5d03097529a9 }}">Brent Ko</a> and the <a href="{{ link:32041aae-58a9-458c-a8f5-613c94cdbca8 }}">Solar Jail</a> for starlight skate nights. On these nights, Solar Jail patrons lay in bubbles in the middle of the skating rink as the trained technicians occasionally shoot them with color combination experience rays, tanning them just as they would be tanned at daytime in the Solar Jail. The Science Department at ACD has began a study on the harmful effects of <a href="{{ link:7a6f339d-b718-4efc-9d29-aee44118b719 }}">Color Combination Experience Rays</a> on humans.</p>'
