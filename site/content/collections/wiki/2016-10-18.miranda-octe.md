Miranda Octe is a vintner who owns and operates [7 Continents (minus one)] winery in [The Adobe Skyscraper]. She is a prominent socialite who attends most of the formal events of the city, unveiling a new (or classic) wine at each. In addition to running the winery, she owns a small vineyard in the [Pleiodon Valley]. She is often seen with her trademark silver spoon, which she uses to sample her wines. It is actually not made of silver, but a chromium-gold alloy that has been coated with a fine layer of silica, allowing for an unbiased and untainted tasting ability.
