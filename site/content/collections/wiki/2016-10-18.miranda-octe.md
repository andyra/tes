    text: '<p>Miranda Octe is a vintner who owns and operates <a href="{{ link:0ad65d27-9688-4013-b8b4-d22186258bb8 }}">7 Continents (minus one) winery</a> in <a href="{{ link:5d2b95f8-0372-4557-a97c-c3c40d7a2f9e }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>. She is a prominent socialite who attends most of the formal events of the city, unveiling a new (or classic) wine at each. In addition to running the winery, she owns a small vineyard in the <a href="{{ link:73ce5f24-4d30-41cd-94a8-7981f44447cc }}">Pleiodon Valley</a>. She is often seen with her trademark silver spoon, which she uses to sample her wines. It is actually not made of silver, but a chromium-gold alloy that has been coated with a fine layer of silica, allowing for an unbiased and untainted tasting ability.</p>'
