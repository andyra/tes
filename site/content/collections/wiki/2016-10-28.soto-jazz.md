Soso Jazz is a style of jazz music invented by virtuoso musician [Ben Soto] in the early 1960s. It is typically "fast and wild" and involves a style of singing where the human voice is nearly indistinguishable from a trumpet. It is often performed with live snakes on the stage so that the musicians "remain in the current of the current" (as described by Ben Soto).

Soto Jazz was outlawed in 1963 by the [National Broadcasting Litigators Guild] because of its ability to inspire dieesent amongst its listeners.
