Glodon is a toxic gas/lighting apparatus developed by the military. It is concealed in small frisbee-like pods that are dropped from blimps or hangliders. These pods glow a bright green color and emit the gas, which renders the enemy combatants incapacitated, while providing light for the incoming ground troops. This project was abandoned because it polluted the environment terribly, and the gas, even in faint quantities, had severe psychological effects on the human brain.
