Alley Flowers is a graduate student at [John Paul Jones Nautical College] working in the lab of [Dr. Yann C'Choa]. She is sort of cranky and has a dry wit. She does the bulk of the work for the research team, and is relentlessly defensive of [Dr. Rabbit], who accordingly treats her better than the other students.
