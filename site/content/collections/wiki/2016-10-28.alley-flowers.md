    text: '<p>Alley Flowers is a graduate student at <a href="{{ link:e6af04d2-e2de-4372-be3f-5e0fdfafecbd }}">John Paul Jones Nautical College</a> working in the lab of <a href="{{ link:32ce0956-fbe9-4ea1-932c-c646e1da2d2a }}">Dr. Yann C''Choa</a>. She is sort of cranky and has a dry wit. She does the bulk of the work for the research team, and is relentlessly defensive of <a href="{{ link:b659159c-cd0c-4187-bbd6-9e73739f4817 }}">Dr. Rabbit</a>, who accordingly treats her better than the other students.&nbsp;</p>'
