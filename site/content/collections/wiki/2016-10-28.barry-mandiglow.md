    text: '<p>Barry Mandiglow is a regular attraction at the <a href="{{ link:dac9d966-6955-4d39-8485-f47dc188404e }}">Neon Parrot Lounge</a>, for what was called Barry Time. At one point due to some medical complications, Barry had his teeth replaced with phosphorescent facsimiles. His teeth actually glow, and when the lights go low and the music begins to pulse, he can tooth-sing, which makes his teeth dance with color. It also produces a pleasing vibrato hum. When Barry is not performing, he works at a lamp store.</p>'
