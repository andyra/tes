    text: '<p>The Solar Pavilion is an endless buffet and sunshine room in <a href="{{ link:5d2b95f8-0372-4557-a97c-c3c40d7a2f9e }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>. Patrons can choose from over thirteen types of soup that are all cooked by solar rays, which are focused by a large geode that hangs from the ceiling at the center of the pavilion. The nutrients inherent in these soups and various casseroles are purportedly amplified by the solar rays, although the concentrated light encourages guests to wear protective eye shades. In addition to gaining nutrients from food, patrons can listen to the soothing sounds of the SCO, which plays continuously until is is dark outside, at which time the pavilion closes for the day. The endless buffet has been rated 3 gold stars by the Dining Commission.</p><p>The Solar Pavilion is owned by <a href="{{ link:f574307d-96a2-40a3-8c6a-0018f1257c70 }}">Janet Valdune</a>, who is a licensed nutritionist and was one of the first to pioneer the use of solar extraction of buried nutrient content from soups. She has been able to extract twelve new vitamins from various soups by employing solar ray treatment. Five of these vitamins alone were extracted from a tasty, but otherwise pedestrian, bean sprout soup. The intensity of the solar rays is modulated by the solar technician, <a href="{{ link:a5595bea-ccef-457f-8e61-5ded0d22b39b }}">Mov Benfield</a>.</p>'
