The Wonderful Land Wonderful Band is a musical ensemble that occasionally performs outdoor shows in rural [Wonderful Land], often in fern grottos or other shady groves. The group was discovered in 1988 by [Ray Wister] at a rest stop along state highway WL-86 (colloquially known as the _Vacation Highway_). According to local legend, Ray Wister first heard them as he emerged from the rest stop bathroom. Guy Steinway, bassist for the band, had this to say about the chance meeting:

> He was very excited and shook each of our hands with much eagerness, although his hands were wet, for the mens' room had run out of paper towels.
