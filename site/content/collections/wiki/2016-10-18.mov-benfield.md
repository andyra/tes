    text: '<p>Mov Benfield is the solar tech who controls the intensity of the geoid output, and monitors the overall ultraviolet levels in the <a href="{{ link:13c14bb5-3cb9-43a4-8038-ca5caf697726 }}">Solar Pavilion</a>, keeping the levels safe for diners. When closing time approaches and the light outside begins to fade, Mov traditionally turns the intensity up to maximum, making it almost impossible to see. This indicates that patrons should finish their dinners, so they donâ€™t find themselves suddenly in the dark trying to pay their tickets.&nbsp;</p>'
