Minotaurs are self-operating law enforcement vehicles that patrol the streets. Upon observation of an infraction of any kind, a minotaur will apprehend the alleged criminal by scooping them up inside its holding bin, fly (or drive, depending on the model) the person back to [Minotaur Mountain] where they must plead their case in front of a judge, pay a fine, or serve detention.

The first minotaurs were self-operating vans that would drive around town looking for law-breakers. Newer models can fly around and look more like a Darth Vader wardrobe capture specter device.
