    text: '<p>Minotaurs are self-operating law enforcement vehicles that patrol the streets. Upon observation of an infraction of any kind, a minotaur will apprehend the alleged criminal by scooping them up inside its holding bin, fly (or drive, depending on the model) the person back to <a href="{{ link:665bf31e-7401-4335-a4c1-7fc6137bf58e }}">Minotaur Mountain</a> where they must plead their case in front of a judge, pay a fine, or serve detention.</p><p>The first minotaurs were self-operating vans that would drive around town looking for law-breakers. Newer models can fly around and look more like a Darth Vader wardrobe capture specter device.</p>'
