Ed Del Santo is the head whale hunter and owner of [Killer Whale Extermination, LLC]. He was trained by none other than [Jackie Cheshire], the matron saint of killer whale hunting. He keeps the [Uluwehi River] and [Lovely Lake] in whale check during the spring, and will exterminate an evil whale at any time in the year. He is a friend to ranchers and beach people everywhere.

Once, he was taken off the bow of his trawler by a killer whale, but he used his namesake [Del Santo Knife] to escape.
