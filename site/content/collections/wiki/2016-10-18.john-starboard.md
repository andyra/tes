John Starboard used to be a Mariner in [Ocean Watch] (the “servants of the sea”), trolling the coast on the lookout for people in distress. One day, in an attempt to help a group of sportsmen locate a school of [silver–beaked Tuna], Starboard came upon an assemblage of ships broadcasting offshore contraband radio under the banner [CKNWR]. He did not locate the fish, but he did quickly become embroiled in the doings of the pirates and before long was assisting them by piloting all around the [Novice Coast] with an antenna affixed to his sailboat in order to broaden the range of the signal.

After some months of this, the NBLG ([National Broadcasting Litigators Guild] (they have an alligator emblem)) cracked down on the operation and destroyed Starboard’s ship. After recovering from Hague’s Fever at the nearby hospital in the [Tennis Islands], Starboard returned to Ocean Watch headquarters, was stripped of his command, and transferred to the [Wilderland Beat].

After a springtime on the Beat, Starboard came across an abandoned, but unused, monorail depot 30 miles south of unincorporated territory. He set up a makeshift broadcasting terminal using a horizontal polarized antenna so that he could not be heard by prying ears (see [Deepak Halliday] for exceptions), a technique he picked up from the CKNWR crew.
