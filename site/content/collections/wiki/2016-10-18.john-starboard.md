    text: '<p>John Starboard used to be a Mariner in <a href="{{ link:ab220435-2dac-4be1-9d17-97e5ac952718 }}">Ocean Watch</a> (the “servants of the sea”), trolling the coast on the lookout for people in distress. One day, in an attempt to help a group of sportsmen locate a school of <a href="{{ link:5cf0d476-44d7-49fc-afd8-5aaa5ff88466 }}">silver–beaked tuna</a>, Starboard came upon an assemblage of ships broadcasting offshore contraband radio under the banner <a href="{{ link:39baa257-910a-4131-bb49-7205ca290245 }}">CKNWR</a>. He did not locate the fish, but he did quickly become embroiled in the doings of the pirates and before long was assisting them by piloting all around the <a href="{{ link:90bf455a-00d2-4911-bef1-17f797c7e5f7 }}">Novice Coast</a> with an antenna affixed to his sailboat in order to broaden the range of the signal.</p><p>After some months of this, the <a href="{{ link:72bc2c38-667c-4f18-bc97-73d08253efd8 }}">NBLG</a> (they have an alligator emblem) cracked down on the operation and destroyed Starboard’s ship. After recovering from Hague’s Fever at the nearby hospital in the <a href="{{ link:7b97b6ae-2aed-4296-8452-bdde733c3885 }}">Tennis Islands</a>, Starboard returned to Ocean Watch headquarters, was stripped of his command, and transferred to the <a href="{{ link:08455962-e700-46fb-a905-ffad0b297c0f }}">Wilderland Beat</a>.</p><p>After a springtime on the Beat, Starboard came across an abandoned, but unused, monorail depot 30 miles south of unincorporated territory. He set up a makeshift broadcasting terminal using a horizontal polarized antenna so that he could not be heard by prying ears, a technique he picked up from the CKNWR crew.</p>'
