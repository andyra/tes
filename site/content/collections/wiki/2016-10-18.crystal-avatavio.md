Crystal Avatavio is the in-house personal trainer at [The Adobe Skyscraper] and the operator of [Adobe Skyscraper Gymnasium]. She has a custom made hoodie that has a hole cut in the back of the hood for her ponytail to stick out. She only eats food that can be said to sprout or have a baby form of (like baby corn / carrots). As part of her 20 hour workday, she speaks encouraging motivational language into a headset microphone for the entire gym to hear.
