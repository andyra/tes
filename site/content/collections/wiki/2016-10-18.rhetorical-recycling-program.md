The rhetorical recycling program is an algorithm designed by [Yousei Soo] for [Intellicast] in which the host's ([Petrigon Chandauff]'s) rhetorical questions are stored and then periodically replayed as non-rhetorical questions for the host to answer. These questions can be stored for many years, providing the opportunity for Chandauff to converse with himself in a non-rhetorical sense.

For example, from the April 17 show in 1984, Chandauff posed the rhetorical question “Did you ever hear such a sound?” Three years later, this question was recycled and posed to Chandauff when he was talking about killer whale hunting horns and their effect on aquatic fauna.
