An octacanonical is someone who believes that life is best understood through the numerical lens of the number Eight. They believe that time has moved mankind from a state of Six, through a conscious and enlightened present state of Seven, towards the ultimate state of Eight. They insist that Eight represents the perfect marriage of humankind and machine. They are very keen to clocks, as this represents for them the most simple yet profound example of a human-machine.
