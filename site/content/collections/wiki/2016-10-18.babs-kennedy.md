    text: '<p>Babs Kennedy is the Quality Control Inspector for <a href="{{ link:5d2b95f8-0372-4557-a97c-c3c40d7a2f9e }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>. Nobody has photographed her closer than 50 yards away; you just see her out of the corner of your eye every now and then, scrutinizing activities, marking something on a clipboard, then disappearing behind some pipes. Nobody knows how long sheâ€™s been working at the skyscraper. Estimates suggest at least 40 years. Her photo ID was once found on the top of the building (not where the <a href="{{ link:32041aae-58a9-458c-a8f5-613c94cdbca8 }}">Solar Jail</a> is, but the other top of it) and on it her photo was taken from 50 yards away so she looked really small. Many skyscraper historians ponder: "What does she look like?"</p><p>She is a believer of the non-invasive school of QC, and as such tries as hard as possible to make reports and observations without influencing the subjects. She is very industrious and consequently the skyscraper has a high degree of quality.</p>'
