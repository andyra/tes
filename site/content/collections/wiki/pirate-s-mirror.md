The Pirate's Mirror is a historic tavern built in the 17th century on the shores of [Lovely Lake] (although at the time (the 17th century, that is), the lake was known as Tal-yn Elmyr HÃ¶edwatyr) and is the oldest continuously operated establishment in a one mile radius, as far as anyone has checked.

It was founded by freshwater pirates who, not having had much luck plundering merchant ships on the lake (of which there weren't any), made themselves useful by brewing and selling ales of dubious description at the tavern. [Ghostbeard] is famously said to have spend a thousand nights in a row at the tavern.

The Pirate's Mirror is probably most well for its [talking circles] which still draw enthusiastic crowds from all over the surrounding area.
