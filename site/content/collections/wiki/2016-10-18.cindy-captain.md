She knows all the goings on of <a href="{{ link:5d2b95f8-0372-4557-a97c-c3c40d7a2f9e }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>. Originally, she was the building manager, but she never knew what was going on with all the occupants. To address the problem, she opened the Captainâ€™s Club and hired a new building manager, <a href="{{ link:3f0c0df9-858c-465d-9252-6e327257736e }}">Edgor G. Worrhen</a>. If you want something done, you gotta see Cindy.</p>'
