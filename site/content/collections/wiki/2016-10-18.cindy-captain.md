Cindy Captain is the owner/operator of the [Captain's Club]. She specializes in catering to the weary workingperson, and is a keen conversationalist. She knows all the goings on of [The Adobe Skyscraper]. Originally, she was the building manager, but she never knew what was going on with all the occupants. To address the problem, she opened the Captainâ€™s Club and hired a new building manager, [Edgor G. Worrhen]. If you want something done, you gotta see Cindy.
