Lawrence “Larry” Sandibolt is the AV technitian for [The Adobe Skyscraper]. He is responsible for maintaining the intercoms, lobby bulletin board, and setting up portable televisions for training sessions or impromptu movie analysis. He received his bachelors in AV from [Adobe College of the Desert] and minored in Binary.

He can read binary code fluently, and usually writes his invoices in binary as well. For this reason he often does not get paid on time. He wears specially designed goggles that allow for him to view his surroundings in nightvision, regardless of the light, which is common for those in the electronics industry. This is because night vision makes it easier to resolve wires from one another, regardless of their colors.
