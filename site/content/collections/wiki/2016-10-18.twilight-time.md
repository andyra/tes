Twilight Time was an investigative mystery/horror TV series that ran from 1950â€“1958 exclusively in [Sondu Bay]. It aired in the latest time slot available and was intended for adult viewership. It was somewhat of a controversial show because it wass billed as "investigative" even though there were obviously phony ghosts, spirits, wraiths, etc. throughout.

Its host, Lawrence Ashley, was a rather mysterious figure himself. He wore black turtlenecks and black woolen overcoats every day, and his stated goal of the series was to "pay homage to the mysterioid." He was last seen in 1959 on a large white disk speeding over the ocean during a thunderstorm.
