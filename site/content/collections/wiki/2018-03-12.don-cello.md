Don Cello was a famous [Black MIDI] drummer for the band [Medieval Wig]. His arms were very flexible and he would swing them like ropes, striking all of the drums and the cymbals nearly simultaneously. He could maintain this intense tempo for tens of minutes. He died of sudden exhaustion at a concert while performing a 10+ minute Black MIDI solo.
