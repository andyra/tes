Buet by Yanna is a jewelry and confectionary store in [The Adobe Skyscraper] that is owned and operated by [Yanna Barom]. Buet is a portmanteau of "beauty" and "duet," as all of Yanna's jewelry serves two purposes: one aesthetic and one functional. For example, some of her highest selling items are the can opener wristwatch and the Geiger counter brooch.
