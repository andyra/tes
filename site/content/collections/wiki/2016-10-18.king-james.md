King James is the last known king in the land now known as [Adobega County]. He was active until about 1940, when he became suddenly very reclusive. Many historians debate whether he is still alive at all. If he is, he is very old, about 100+ years, but centurions are not unheard of and King James was a healthy man, by all accounts. Technically, almost 90% of the city of [Adobe Skyscraper] is still owned by him, though his lack of successors and general un-involvement makes this more of a curiosity than a legality.

He is known for traveling around the county one of his many [GEAP]s.
