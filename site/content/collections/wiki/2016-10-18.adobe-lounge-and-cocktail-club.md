The Adobe Lounge and Cocktail Club is located on the first floor of [The Adobe Skyscraper]. It is famous for it's dinner salads and it's signature cocktail, the [Adobe Sunset]. It is operated by [Elaine Bordeaux].

The Adobe Lounge and Cocktail Club traditionally features a twilight music hour, at 9pm sharp. With almost no exception, this music hour consists of the smooth crooning and poetry of [Montague Casillas], who always sings at least one song seated at a patron's table.
