    text: '<p>Max Schlenk is the son of Mayor Von Schlenk, who is on a cruise along with his aunt as a result of unfinished mayoral business. He is in his early twenties and has always worked city jobs. He thinks he needs to get rich quick so he can stop working these city jobs, so he decides to try and steal a painting that Edison brings on board. He talks his aunt into helping him.&nbsp;</p>'
