    text: '<p>Gretch Zbarkl is a world-renowned skier and twelve time slalom champion at the Snow Sport Championships. Being from <a href="{{ link:c2cbd121-6999-4ebf-93d0-c010f8fdcefd }}">Adobe Skyscraper</a>, she began skiing at the age of three on the bunny slopes of <a href="{{ link:3d1f5047-3a13-4959-bb2b-4d2761891189 }}">Gorami Mountain</a>, and has skied more than 80% of her life. She was the first to pioneer the sleep ski, which is the art of skiing down a well-groomed blue slope while asleep.</p><p>Gretch can usually be found carving the upper slopes of Gorami, routinely navigating some of the most difficult runs with record time. She rarely has contact with anyone other than an occasional joint gondola ride with her nemesis, <a href="{{ link:579b8f82-e6b2-4458-8caf-cf46699ec04a }}">Sue Ellen Farmsadd</a>, although occasionally she will come to Adobe Skyscraper to make a celebrity appearance.</p>'
