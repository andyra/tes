Gretch Zbarkl is a world-renowned skier and twelve time slalom champion at the Snow Sport Championships. Being from [Adobe Skyscraper], she began skiing at the age of three on the bunny slopes of [Gorami Mountain], and has skied more than 80% of her life. She was the first to pioneer the sleep ski, which is the art of skiing down a well-groomed blue slope while asleep.

Gretch can usually be found carving the upper slopes of [Gorami], routinely navigating some of the most difficult runs with record time. She rarely has contact with anyone other than an occasional joint gondola ride with her nemesis, [Sue Ellen Farmsadd], although occasionally she will come to Adobe Skyscraper to make a celebrity appearance.
