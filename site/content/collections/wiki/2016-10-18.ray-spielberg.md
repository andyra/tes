Ray Spielberg was a millionaire and amateur zoologist (he calls himself an "animalist") who made his fortune from copywrite revenue. He is responsible for discovering and naming the [Spielberg Bat], which he found while excavating a cave near his [Pleidon Valley] home to house his exotic sports car collection.

He died in 2012 when he drove his white 1980 Terrerra convertable off a cliff and into the Great Geodesic Home at the [Fair of the Universe]. He was eating cereal at the time.
