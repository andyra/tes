Rick Reception is the security guard for [The Adobe Skyscraper] lobby. He specializes in being able to twist peopleâ€™s arms in funny ways and then walk them in any direction he wants while they wince and tip-toe ahead of him. He always wears a vest and no shirt as his uniform, and he has exceptional hearing. He is a man of few words. If you have business in the skyscraper then he will treat you cordially, but if you are a hang-around, he will promptly escort you out of the building.

There was a video game called Rick Reception that was popular in the arcades for a few years that involved a protagonist trying to climb various sets of stairs while the eponymous villain bounded after him. This game was most likely designed by one of the many youth that Rick threw out of the skyscraper over the years as a form of revenge. Ironically, Rick plays this game in his spare time, when he is not doing pushups or throwing tires.
