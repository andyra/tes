Dr. Anthony Rabbit is the post-doctoral student of [Dr. C’Choa] who has arranged the team to reserve the lower deck of the cruise ship, in the guise of saving money but in the reality of being with [Lilly Moon], whom he met at a recent drug symposium. He is bent on pleasing her and manipulates his personality to suit what he thinks she likes, even going so far as to pretend to be a country-western singer on the side.

He is quiet and stands awkwardly to the side in big groups but is very clever in one-on-one conversation, and can be quite manipulative as a result. He doesn’t realize that Lilly is married but does not give up pursuit when he discovers that she is. He has a short temper with the equipment and with the graduate students.
