    text: '<p>Dr. Anthony Rabbit is the post-doctoral student of <a href="{{ link:32ce0956-fbe9-4ea1-932c-c646e1da2d2a }}">Dr. C’Choa</a> who has arranged the team to reserve the lower deck of the cruise ship, in the guise of saving money but in the reality of being with <a href="{{ link:73fb0628-eaf1-4bc7-a865-547992acb79d }}">Lilly Moon</a>, whom he met at a recent drug symposium. He is bent on pleasing her and manipulates his personality to suit what he thinks she likes, even going so far as to pretend to be a country-western singer on the side.</p><p>He is quiet and stands awkwardly to the side in big groups but is very clever in one-on-one conversation, and can be quite manipulative as a result. He doesn’t realize that Lilly is married but does not give up pursuit when he discovers that she is. He has a short temper with the equipment and with the graduate students.&nbsp;</p>'
