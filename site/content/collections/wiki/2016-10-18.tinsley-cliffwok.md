He is a famous fashion icon, who utilizes his very expensive home radio receiver to listen to newly released music from the other side of the globe, which he then plays in the lobby of the Skyscraper. He usually plays 10â€“12 hours a day, so his hands and fingernails need quite a bit of attention. Because of this, he decided to open his own hair and nail salon, <a href="{{ link:001c17f9-1038-4f58-9906-d4683dbfaa2d }}">Tinsley''s</a>. He gives himself a 90% discount on manicures but pays full price for his haircuts.</p>'
