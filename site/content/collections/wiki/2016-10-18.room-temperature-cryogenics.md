Room-Temperature Cryogenics is a technology developed in the early 1970s by [Dr. Jason Dudley-Nathan] and colleagues at [Monorail Medical Center]. The technology involves the introduction of a proprietary polymer composed partially of chloroplasts and formaldehyde into the subcutaneous tissue of deceased patients. The polymer is able to insulate the vital organs while simultaneously utilizing photo-induced synthesis of synthetic ATP (sATP).
