Timothy Grass Blindness is an optical phenomena that occurs when someone has been exposed to surroundings of [Timothy Grass] for an extended period of time. The rods and cones of the eye become saturated and the sufferer's vision melds into a blurry sky-blue yellow color. This can last for several days and may be permanent if exposure to Timothy Grass is continued. This can be prevented by wearing yellow-tinted glasses that effectively screen out the irritating wavelengths associated with Timothy Grass.
