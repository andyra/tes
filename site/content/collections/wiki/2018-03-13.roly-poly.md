    text: '<p>Roly Poly is a mugger who operates in downtown <a href="{{ link:20e35b3a-534f-42e6-a402-597d774ecc5a }}">Adobe Skyscraper</a>. He has no legs, but sits in the lower section of a discarded grocery cart. He will launch himself down hills, sucker punching unsuspecting pedestrians in the gut, and then rob them while they are incapacitated, putting his ''loot'' up in the grocery cart. His real name is unknown.</p>'
