Devin Hoover is a boy who loved to hide indoor in the dark and play video games. He was once taken to a waterpark and forgotten. He spent several days living under the waterslide eating corndogs. He would go running through the park at night, because his skin was badly sunburned. His pinkish hue and amphibious behavior earned him the nickname "The Pink Salamander." He would go on to run the 1800 for his track team.
