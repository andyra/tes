    text: '<p>Black MIDI is a style of music in which the performers begin playing faster and faster until it is as though they are performing a MIDI file in which all data points are "blacked out" and all notes are played simultaneously. It is very intense music the usually results in one or more of the band members passing out after a few minutes due to exhaustion. This is often experienced by the fans of the music as well. A well-known black MIDI drummer, [Don Cello], died while performing a long black MIDI piece at a festival.</p><h2>Notable Black Midi Artists</h2><ul><li><a href="{{ link:7df96035-d30a-412c-997e-7e643ed9f058 }}">Hail Seizure</a></li><li><a href="{{ link:340b0107-bb8f-44e9-ba38-3911b07f6158 }}">Hold Down the Emperor</a></li><li><a href="{{ link:a32b06c6-a0ad-4349-953e-4292873ec367 }}">Medieval Wig</a> (esp. <a href="{{ link:b34fe60a-0960-401d-a05c-cefd0854be6d }}">Don Cello</a>)</li></ul><h2>Black MIDI and Counterculture</h2><p><a href="{{ link:f239653a-eba5-4556-a4a3-6c147c18c92e }}">Minotaurs</a> are especially sensitive to the resonant low frequency overtones created by bass guitar played between 1000â€“1500BPM. As such, Black MIDI is oftentimes performed at festivals and concerts as a way to create a "lawless and free wild zone" free of Minotaur monitoring. Proponents of Black MIDI tend to have spotless criminal records since they are rarely apprehended by Minotaur patrols.</p>'
