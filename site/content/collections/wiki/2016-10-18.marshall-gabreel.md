    text: '<p>Marshall Gabreel was a war veteran who began the <a href="{{ link:27d626e1-a49e-4a12-8906-5b72fcd655ca }}">Hobo</a> lifestyle after returning to civilian life, incorporating much of what heâ€™d learned while on in service in the wilderness. He began the <a href="{{ link:80e794a9-8c2d-4996-bcbb-41d00441ea07 }}">Friendship Gang</a> to help Hobos build a reliable network. He died of natural causes, but his body was preserved and turned into a radio transmitter, which was subsequently stolen and attached to one of the news satellites in the University Satellite Fleet.</p>'
