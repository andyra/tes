Marshall Gabreel was a war veteran who began the [Hobo] lifestyle after returning to civilian life, incorporating much of what heâ€™d learned while on in service in the wilderness. He began the [Friendship Gang] to help Hobos build a reliable network. He died of natural causes, but his body was preserved and turned into a radio transmitter, which was subsequently stolen and attached to one of the News Satellites in the University Satellite Fleet.
