Dr. Yann Câ€™Choa is the head scientist from [John Paul Jones Nautical College]. He is leading a small research team on this cruise and they have reserved the lower deck for their experiments, which involve trying to induce triplet state phosphorescence in jellyfish utilizing underwater lasers and cryogenic temperatures. He is very loud spoken and often sees things that he assumes are great discoveries or at least rare occurrences but always soon comes to the realization that they are very commonplace and gives a sort of lecture about the commonality that has occurred. He loves to talk about his wife and things that she has done. She was a clown, apparently, and she made him laugh so hard that it caused him health problems.
