Dan Djini is an attorney who works out of [The Adobe Skyscraper]. He claims to have [djini] blood in his lineage, and as such, has an impressive history of winning trials when his client submits their plea or charge in the form of a wish.

## Scientific Evidence

After Mr. Djini failed to convict a known larcenist in a high profile case, a group of skeptics pooled their resources to have his backstory verified, most notably his claim to djini-hood. Scientists worked for ten days collecting tissue samples, hair samples, and hip-hop samples from his body and sent him through rigorous testing indeed. The results concluded that his body contained on average a few more percentage points of water content than the average 71% that most humans exhibit. As djinis are composed mostly of water, it is technically feasible that Dan is part djini, although the scientists involved refused to make a claim either way.
