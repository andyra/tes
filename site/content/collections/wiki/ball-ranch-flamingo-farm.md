    text: '<p>The Ball Ranch Flamingo Farm is a wildlife preserve established with the aim of educating flamingos to be productive members in their own society. It is maintained by an android who "has no rememberance of former things."</p><h2>Educational Methodology</h2><p>The Ranch''s educational style can be described as a marriage between traditional Montessori (champtioned by avian professor&nbsp;<a href="{{ link:ed08f15d-92de-4a36-86e4-244f45e52ffe }}">Mr. Gladiola</a>), and brute force intimidation via chainsaws. Birds that don''t graduate from the program are often eaten by visitors to the Ranch''s cafeteria.</p>'
