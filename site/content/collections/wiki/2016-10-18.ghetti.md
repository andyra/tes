A ghetti is a large, hairy animal that resembles an aardvark-gorilla. They are typically a bright red or orange color, and they reside in mountain passes on the rain-soaked slopes of [Multiple Mountain]. If a hiker or traveler comes across one, they might very well get crushed. Ghettis have terribly powerful embraces, and they literally crush those whom they sense as a treat. They are herbivorous.
