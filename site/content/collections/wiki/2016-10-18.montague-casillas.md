    text: '<p>Montague Casillas is a famous lounge singer and reciter of poetry who traditionally performs at the <a href="{{ link:1d88eeeb-5a28-438a-8532-2114c4af44dc }}">Adobe Lounge and Cocktail Club</a>. He is always seen wearing his trademark sunshades, and he usually speaks in rhymes. The lyrics to his most popular songs consist of a repetition of his name, and occasional oohs and OHâ€™s. He is very popular for ribbon cutting ceremonies, as he sings throughout the entirety of the event, at no extra charge.</p>'
