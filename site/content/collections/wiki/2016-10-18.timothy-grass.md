    text: '<p>Timothy Grass is a ubiquitous prairie grass in <a href="{{ link:8e2e83ac-f973-459a-abea-bc00b2a7e441 }}">Wonderful Land</a>, and is prevalent in the western slopes of <a href="{{ link:20e35b3a-534f-42e6-a402-597d774ecc5a }}">Adobe Skyscraper</a> on the banks of the <a href="{{ link:822e08cb-bc02-4704-9b84-677e8190651d }}">Uluwehi River</a>. It is a large grass that grows tens of feet in the air, and is an intense yellow-green color. Wandering through thick regions of Timothy Grass can cause optical irritation and may lead to <a href="{{ link:1c7cea8a-38e9-4e56-ad0c-4ed969d0c055 }}">Timothy Grass Blindness</a>. The bean of Timothy Grass makes wonderful coffee, but it is very hard to harvest due to the obstinate nature of the grass itself.</p>'
