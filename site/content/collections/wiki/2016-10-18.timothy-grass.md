Timothy Grass is a ubiquitous prairie grass in [Wonderful Land], and is prevalent in the western slopes of [Adobe Skyscraper] on the banks of the [Uluwehi River]. It is a large grass that grows tens of feet in the air, and is an intense yellow-green color. Wandering through thick regions of Timothy Grass can cause optical irritation and may lead to [Timothy Grass Blindness]. The bean of Timothy Grass makes wonderful coffee, but it is very hard to harvest due to the obstinate nature of the grass itself.
