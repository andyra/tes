“Jolly” Molly Szipastica was the one-legged female lead singer at the [Neon Parrot Lounge]. She was a little bit saucy and quite beloved by the regulars. She would lean upon the piano, either singing countermelodies in a slightly husky drawl or she would make provocative comments to other people, on stage or in the audience.

She lost her leg in the fire that burned down the first floor of the Neon Parrot Lounge building, which was of course the warehouse in which [Mr. Capestrano] kept his supply of body doubles. That is to say, she lost her prosthetic leg in the fire. Her _actual_ leg was lost during her employment to Mr. Capestrano. She would count cards for him or pick people up at the airport or sometimes oversee the purchase of some exotic, dangerous animal. Her leg was of course bitten off by a [hippogator], a wholly common thing to have happen when dealing with these creatures.
