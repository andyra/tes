Obadiah Whitvee was Mr. Capestrano’s body double maker. He was raised as a puppeteer and a marionette carver, but soon became burdened by gambling debts, and so came into the employment of [Mr. Capestrano]. He was constantly refinishing and repairing the body doubles that were being burned and shot up and exploded in attempts to get to Mr. Capestrano. Unfortunately, the highly flammable lacquer that Obadiah had to apply to the body doubles was ignited by a stray cigarette ash, probably from [Joe Pasteroni]. This burned up the body double warehouse and workshop, while simultaneously leading to the inception of the [Neon Parrot Lounge].
