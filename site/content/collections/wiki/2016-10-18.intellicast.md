Intellicast is a radio program broadcast weeknights from 8:45-10:00 on [CKNWR]. It is hosted by [Petri Chandauff] and is a talk-format broadcast concerned with intellectual subject matter. The show generally involves the host giving an introduction to some topic of his interests before waxing philosophically about that and any non-sequitors of his fancy for 45 minutes. The final half hour is generally devoted to call-ins from listeners who have been thinking about the first portion of the show.

Intellicast is produced by [Yousei Soo], who introduced groundbreaking concepts such as the focus algorithm and the rhetorical recycling program.
