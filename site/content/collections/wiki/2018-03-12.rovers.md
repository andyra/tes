Rovers are employees of City Services. They patrol the city helping citizens with issues such as construction projects, repairs to things, property maintenance, and animal disputes and traffic issues. They broadcast a morning radio show about the coming day called [Rover Update], which includes recorded calls from citizens and the subsequent Rover response.
