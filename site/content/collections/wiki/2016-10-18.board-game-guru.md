Board Game Guru is the greatest board game player of all time, and people often seek him out in his store, [Board Game Guru], which is located in [The Adobe Skyscraper] to learn secrets of old board games and find out what board game he is currently into. He has greenish skin, long arms to make reaching a board game from a cross-legged position very easy, and very strong eyes, with which he observes every possible movement of the board game.

People sometimes imitate the board game guru by applying a skin product called [Embossable Green] on themselves.
