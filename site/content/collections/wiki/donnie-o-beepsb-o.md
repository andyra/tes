Donny O'Beepsb'o is a teenager who makes a living by entering (and usually winning) extemporaneous drag races on Friday nights at the abandoned highway near the [City Burger]. He drives a gold flake 1974 Heinz Tuscana which he and his mother, Brinda O'Beepsb'o, plated with lead panels in order to dampen the sound of the custom-built [Bogarth Engine] when idling at lower speeds.
