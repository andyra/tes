The Dead Man Protection Act is an law that was enacted to protect [dead men] from harassment while in their inactive state. In short, one cannot simply "give 'em a go simply to give 'em a go". Prior to the act, people would harass dead men for the fun of it, or simply because they did not appreciate one lying motionless in their den.
