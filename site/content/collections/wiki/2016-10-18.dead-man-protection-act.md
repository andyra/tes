    text: '<p>The Dead Man Protection Act is an law that was enacted to protect <a href="{{ link:417210d8-2c39-48eb-b704-5aa2e48ff88b }}">dead men</a> from harassment while in their inactive state. In short, one cannot simply "give ''em a go simply to give ''em a go". Prior to the act, people would harass dead men for the fun of it, or simply because they did not appreciate one lying motionless in their den.</p>'
