A style of music popularized by [Art Zandifur], identifiable by its lengthy compositions which invariable start very quiet and end up extremely loud. In the genre's most popular song, _Shall We Trance?_, the musicians are not heard at all for the first 1:30 of the composition. They poise expectantly on front of their trumpets until the proper moment when they begin to press keys on their horns. This develops into a gentle susurrating of wind being blown through the trumpets, to faint notes, to quiet playing, moderate, then loud, quite loud, very loud, and finally culminating in a sound that is much too loud.
