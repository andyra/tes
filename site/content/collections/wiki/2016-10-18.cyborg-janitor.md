    text: '<p>When citizens turn 16 years of age, they can legally obtain a driver''s license. But they can also decide, in the event of a tragic, life-threatening accident event, if they would like for the government to intervene and save them. These types of interventions usually involve the installation of many synthetic and mechanical components that replace  essential bodily functions. If these replacement parts sum up to more than 75% of the original person, they are considered by definition to be a cyborg.</p><p>Of course, saving a person''s life is priceless, but it is also very expensive. For this reason, when a person declares that they wish to be saved by cyborg transformation in the event of an untimely accident, upon such incident and subsequent cyborg transformation they are conscripted into general custodial service and must work the rest of their time as cyborg janitors for the high school or private residents who pay cyborg taxes or at places like <a href="{{ link:5d2b95f8-0372-4557-a97c-c3c40d7a2f9e }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>. Cyborg janitors look much like other people, except for their uniforms, name changes, and the fact that cell phone transmissions mess with their brains.&nbsp;</p>'
