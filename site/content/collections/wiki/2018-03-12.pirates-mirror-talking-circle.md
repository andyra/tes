    text: '<p>There is a lake-side pub called the <a href="{{ link:785c3a55-787f-4367-ab83-3309374d6bc1 }}">Pirate''s Mirror</a> where various characters have gathered throughout the decades to drink ale and grog and dandelion martinis. Some of the more dedicated customers gather at a large circular table in the back of the pub to talk. They keep copious records of the ongoing conversation in large leather journals. There are many volumes, and the members of the talking circle believe they hold great meaning, once they have been completed and analyzed. Sometimes a talking circle will get so out of hand, it will fling the members away. These will eventually be replaced by new members, who will again restart the talking circle.</p><p>Talking circles have been in continuous rotation for several centuries.</p>'
