    text: '<p>Lilly Moon is <a href="{{ link:ec0af3bb-50ad-408a-8367-bd76c77cb9eb }}">Alfred Moon''s</a> wife who is a marketing rep for a drug company and makes a good deal of money. She is tall and beautiful and aloof, and seemingly unhappy with Alfred, especially as she says this all the time. It seems his lack of an opinion is frustrating to her, and he doesnâ€™t like country-western music, which she thinks is the best. She has paid for this trip and is unhappy that Heady has booked himself as the Tuesday lunch and Thursday night entertainment. She is very open to people with strong opinions, and county-western singers.</p>'
