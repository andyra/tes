    text: '<p>Randy is the name of the large clock face on the southwest side of <a href="{{ link:5d2b95f8-0372-4557-a97c-c3c40d7a2f9e }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>. Randy is made of mirrored glass and was built to be slightly concave in shape. Therefore, the direct sunlight in the afternoon glints off of Randy and sends a focused beam of light down into the city, where it moves about according to the time of day. People sometimes cleanse themselves by running through this beam, though they usually get burned pretty good. There is a scorched path along the city known as "Randyâ€™s Pilgrimage" and some people take this very seriously.</p>'
