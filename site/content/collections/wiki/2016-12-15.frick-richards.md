    text: '<p>Frick Richards is sort of a transcendental phenomena that has simultaneously done everything and nothing ever. Those who think about him too much often suffer from what is called <a href="{{ link:19906916-a45b-43f7-9485-1ce7fdffe4c9 }}">Frick Richards Disease</a>, and become somewhat paralyzed in their thoughts and actions. When children think on his abstractness too much, they develop a similar problem, called Frick Jr Disease.&nbsp;</p>'
