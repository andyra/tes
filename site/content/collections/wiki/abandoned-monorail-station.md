The monorail system was a part of [Adobega County]'s efforts to tie its far-flung districts together with a transporation system, based on the success seen in [Monorail City]. Many are still functional, but Station 5B in [Del Daurin]'s [Unincorporated Territory] never became functional.

It is currently the central broadcasting location for [This Evening's Show].
