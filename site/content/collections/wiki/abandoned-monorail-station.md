      <p>The monorail system was a part of <a href="{{ link:42d6701d-02af-42e5-b156-dc4dd348f499 }}">Adobega County's</a>&nbsp;efforts to tie its far-flung districts together with a transporation system, based on the success seen in <a href="{{ link:3e664a00-7574-44aa-970b-fff26a06d4f4 }}">Monorail City</a>. Many are still functional, but Station 5B in <a href="{{ link:dc7de195-c92c-47ee-a9d0-891b64bac5d3 }}">Del Daurin's</a>&nbsp;Unincorporated Territory never became functional.
      
      It is currently the central broadcasting location for <a href="{{ link:694a5ed5-39fa-49df-99c6-c27c0dec2bca }}">This Evening's Show</a>.</p>
