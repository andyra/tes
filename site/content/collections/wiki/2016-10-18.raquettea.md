Raquettea (pronounced racket-tea) is a beverage made from the steeped leaves of the [Badminton Tree] combined with blueberries and mint. It is a popular afternoon beverage that is initially consumed at a high temperature (around 50°C) but very rapidly decreases to a sub-freezing temperature (around -3°C). This curious plunge in temperature is due to the interaction of the blueberries with the stringent acid of the Badminton Tree leaves. For a typical serving (around 2 cups) this temperature swing occurs over about twenty seconds. It is the combination of this riveting swoop in temperature and the natural stimulants of the ingredients that makes the beverage so popular for mid-afternoon workers.
