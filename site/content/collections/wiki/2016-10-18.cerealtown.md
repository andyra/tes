Cerealtown is a neighborhood in [Adobe Skyscraper]. It is called Cerealtown because much of the neighborhood's financing came directly from [Mr. Capestrano], most likely through his cereal sales. The neighborhood lies just south of [Lovely Lake], at the foot of [Mr. Capestrano's Mountain]. At one point there were massive cereal farms in this acreage, but they were closed down after the [Cereal Restriction Act].
