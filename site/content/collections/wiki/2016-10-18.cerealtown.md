    text: '<p>Cerealtown is a neighborhood in <a href="{{ link:20e35b3a-534f-42e6-a402-597d774ecc5a }}">Adobe Skyscraper</a>. It is called Cerealtown because much of the neighborhood''s financing came directly from <a href="{{ link:42c9a554-73d3-4820-b319-326f8aa6ee21 }}">Mr. Capestrano</a>, most likely through his cereal sales. The neighborhood lies just south of <a href="{{ link:65bac99a-7143-41e0-8613-b4df1677e812 }}">Lovely Lake</a>, at the foot of <a href="{{ link:c97b3acf-d4ba-47ef-91a2-03b56fd322ea }}">Mr. Capestrano''s Mountain</a>. At one point there were massive cereal farms in this acreage, but they were closed down after the <a href="{{ link:6db87929-8113-4398-8bf6-9ec0ad7bb3d4 }}">Cereal Restriction Act</a>.</p>'
