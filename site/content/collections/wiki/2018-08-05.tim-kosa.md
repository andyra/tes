    text: '<p>Tim Kosa hosts his own radio station 24/7, called the <a href="{{ link:be7e0e5e-b2ce-4d46-b1a8-1f52412b5657 }}">Kosa Channel</a>. He usually stands outside in his alley talking about whatever comes across his mind. He sometimes interacts with other people walking through the alley. His radio station has no sponsors, commercials, music, or content beyond his (and his cousin <a href="{{ link:6b550995-519e-477c-8978-bed7f7a7fae8 }}">Tim Kosa''s</a>) talking and occasional interactions. It is hard to find on the radio, using fractional frequencies.&nbsp;</p>'
