    text: '<p>Howard E. Bonebreak is an unusual character in that all of his bones are broken, making him a very flexible jelly sort of a man. He has saved his nose from being broken, with the intent of having it broken by his new bride when he is married. He plans on having her step on his face, cracking his nose under her heel, and so signifying the beginning of their blissful marriage.&nbsp;</p>'
