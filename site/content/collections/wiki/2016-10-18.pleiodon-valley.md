A semiarid biome located near the [Modal Desert] which is home to no less than 38 different wineries, including [7 Continents Minus One]. Despite it's somewhat harsh climate, the valley is a popular spot for wineries because of the soil quality, which is said to be rich due to the vast amount of ancient dinosaur remains. For every winery, there are 3 paleontological dig sites.
