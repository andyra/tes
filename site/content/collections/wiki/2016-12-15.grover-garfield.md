Grover Garfield is the captain of the boat who makes official announcements on a regular basis and has a tendency to be unclear and alarming. He is a poor jokester and often jests about throwing people overboard, especially little kids.

He is now the Commodore of the floating city state of [Lost Cruzes]. He is injured in the head by a falling boon and is in a coma, but he is still in charge.
