Father Liam Lamar is the keeper of the clock at the top of the [Adobe Skyscraper], which is called Randy. Time is a sacred business, so all clock keepers must be ordained. He is an active [Octacanonical], as most clock keepers tend to be. He is rarely seen around the Adobe Skyscraper but he loves to come down from the clock rooms when there is a cheese buffet.
