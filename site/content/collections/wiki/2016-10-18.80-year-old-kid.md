[Dr. Jeremy Scrines] of the [Scrines Aging Institute] is credited for having successfully identified the first 80-year old kid some good while ago. The scientific community is always looking for new subjects to expand their knowledge of the enigma, although defining an 80 year-old kid has proven difficult. Every time an exhaustive list of features is published, someone spots an 80 year-old kid who fits all the current descriptions and yet does something NEW. The Monorailish scholar [Dr. Bvick Vwavlavik] famously noted that:

> Our century has come to the conclusion that a comprehensive definition of 80YOK is not only impossible, but also very difficult to achieve.
