The Adobe Skyscraper Gymnasium is a health club in [The Adobe Skyscraper]. It offers state-of-the-art workout equipment and is free to use for any tenants of the building, as well as visiting foreign dignitaries. Some of the features include solid mahogany floors, a Rhumbix room, free and ply weights, locker rooms with sleep cubbies, and origami waterfall shower heads.

The Gymnasium is run by [Crystal Avatavio], who constantly speaks encouragement into her headset microphone for the entire gym.
