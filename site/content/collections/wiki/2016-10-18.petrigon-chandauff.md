Petrigon “Petrie” Chandauff is the host of [Intellicast]. He is classically trained in radio opera and received his masters in Intellectual Thought from [Monorail City University] before completing his broadcast certification. In addition to his general knowledge and grand radio presence, he is well-travelled, having spent a year in Gsveig at the [Institution Heavythought].

He generally opens up the Intellicast show with a 15 minute speech about the intellectual thoughts he has experienced that day, and allows the following 30 minutes to "grow new thoughts" from this speech. This is a technique he has termed "brain bloom" and he periodically teaches a class at [Adobe College of the Desert] on this topic. The final half hour of his show is devoted to discussing the brain blooms that he and his listeners have cultivated that evening.

Petrie is involved with the cultural scene of Adobe Skyscraper and often writes theatre critiques as well as sports recaps for the local papers. Because of his operatic radio voice, he is also involved with singing the opening song for sporting events, and providing color commentary for large events, such as the Desert Knoll 600 auto race.
