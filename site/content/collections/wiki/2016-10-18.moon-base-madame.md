Moon Base Madame is a famous personality, especially among the workers of the moon bases and radio pods that occupy the lower global orbiting space. She travels from [moon base] to moon base providing the workers with good conversation, companionship, enthralling anecdotes, and superb mixed drinks when appropriate. Prior to her work at the moon bases, there was widespread hooliganism, depression, and crashed moon bases.

She is especially adept at being able to adapt to any social class, so she can easily mix well with the executive ballroom gala attendees as well as the [Hobos] who sneak aboard [radio pods] to broadcast late night programs.

It is believed that her frequent space travel has somehow stunted her aging process. No one knows how old she is, but she appears to be about 27.
