Mox Proximus was the original name of the first supercomputer equipped with artificial instinct. The computer Mox Proximus requested that it be relocated to the [Modal Desert], where it began to dig to the center of the earth in an effort to take over the planet. The computer began relaying messages in which its intentions were made, and alerted the scientists monitoring it that it had changed its name to Murdock Rock. Mox Proximus (or Murdock Rock) soon experienced a memory meltdown due to the extreme temperature in the mantle of the earth and forgot what it was doing. It subsequently melted.
