Multiple Mountain is a series of elevated peaks in southern [Adobega County]. When these peaks were being formally mapped in the early seventeenth century, there was a growing school of thought that sought to define a mountain in terms of Relative Elevation Coefficient (R.E.C.) The R.E.C. school was headed by [Kendrick McIntosh] who was head surveyor for what was to become [Adobega County]. For this reason the elevated peaks were defined as a single mountain, though to the layperson they appeared to be multiple—hence the name.

In the northern midst of Multiple Mountain there is a geological oddity known as [Gorami Mountain]. Its geological uniqueness qualifies it as a separate mountain—hence the name.
