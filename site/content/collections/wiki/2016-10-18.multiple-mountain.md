    text: '<p>Multiple Mountain is a series of elevated peaks in southern <a href="{{ link:42d6701d-02af-42e5-b156-dc4dd348f499 }}">Adobega County</a>. When these peaks were being formally mapped in the early seventeenth century, there was a growing school of thought that sought to define a mountain in terms of Relative Elevation Coefficient (R.E.C.) The R.E.C. school was headed by <a href="{{ link:5f01ae50-a789-44a7-aa8b-0b3645831332 }}">Kendrick McIntosh</a> who was head surveyor for what was to become Adobega County. For this reason the elevated peaks were defined as a single mountain, though to the layperson they appeared to be multiple—hence the name.</p><p>In the northern midst of Multiple Mountain there is a geological oddity known as <a href="{{ link:3d1f5047-3a13-4959-bb2b-4d2761891189 }}">Gorami Mountain</a>. Its geological uniqueness qualifies it as a separate mountain—hence the name.</p>'
