A massive tome of business terminology and jargon used as a reference in legal circles and court battles. It is the favorite book of [Judge Leroy], who famously quipped that all-star lawyer [Dan Djini] has "weaponsized the good book to win cases that should not have been won."

The namesake "Loyell" has been lost to time.
