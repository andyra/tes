Hurricane Thor is a class 19 hurricane that has been in existence for well over 10,000 years by meteorologists estimates. It usually storms around the ocean, but occasionally will make landfall and destroy most anything in its path. It can be seen from over 90 miles away and few people have actually experienced it without ill effect.
