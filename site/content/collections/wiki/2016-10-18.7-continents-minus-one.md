7 Continents (minus one) is a winery located in [The Adobe Skyscraper]. It produces wine made from fruit that is imported from six different continents, but it is a trade secret as to which continents it actually utilizes for its wines. The winery is owned and operated by master vintner [Miranda Octe], who also has a small vineyard in the [Pleiodon Valley] south of [Adobe Skyscraper]. It is from this vineyard that she produces her “Backyard Wine” series.
