    text: '<p>Ben Soto was a musician and philosopher who popularized the style of music that came to be known as <a href="{{ link:b5059eef-3616-47a9-9a15-2b31d6cd64d1 }}">Soto Jazz</a>. He was well known for having long fingernails and often kept live cobras on stage with him.</p><p>He was officially censored by the <a href="{{ link:72bc2c38-667c-4f18-bc97-73d08253efd8 }}">National Broadcasting Litigators'' Guild</a> (NBLG) in 1963 under the auspices of "inciting to conspire" and summarily deported. He spent the next 20 years recording and performing his music in neutral territory waters off the <a href="{{ link:7b97b6ae-2aed-4296-8452-bdde733c3885 }}">Tennis Islands</a>, broadcasting over ham radio frequencies and partying when possible. He is something of a counter cultural cult figure due to his stubborn and principled stance against the NBLG.</p><p>He is presumed to have died in a kitchen grease fire aboard the S.S. Philharmoniq in 1992, although there have been numerous sightings over the years of apperances behind a Kilgour A-900 synthesizer at the <a href="{{ link:e9ed3631-53b2-43c9-b15f-452b8a52abf9 }}">Desert Door Jazz Club</a>. None have been confirmed.</p>'
