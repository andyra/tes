The Bogarth Engine is a variant of the internal cumbustion engine that converts sound into energy. They are very efficient at high speeds and are, in theory, completely silent when pushed to their limits. At moderate to slower speeds, however, they are unbearably loud.

Cars with Bogarth Engines are popular for drag racing under the [Yakov Tinktur Mall].
