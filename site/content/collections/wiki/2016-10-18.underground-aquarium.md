The Underground Aquarium is an aquarium located in the basement of [The Adobe Skyscraper]. It contains over 1500 species of aquatic flora and fauna. Initially, it was constructed to fill in the large caverns that once housed the cheese caverns of [King James]. These caverns, having been depleted many years before the skyscraper was built, did not offer the proper support for a large structure. It was decided by the engineers to fill the space with various aquariums and archways. It has proven to be extremely popular with the public and is open 24 hours a day. It is also curious that due to the nocturnal nature of an underground aquarium, many of the creatures behave quite differently than they would in normal daylight circumstances. For example, the [Pygmie Suck], which is usually a very aggressive animal and difficult to contain in an aquarium environment, is quite docile underground.

The aquarium is operated by [Dr. Emily Plantana]. She has implemented such concepts as the glass crawl tubes for patrons to crawl out into the aquarium environments.
