The focus algorithm is a program designed by [Yousei Soo] for [Intellicast] to measure the amount of focus that a caller has to a specified theme. The algorithm works by constantly collecting the concepts that are introduced during the first 45 minutes of the broadcast, and then comparing the comments made by callers to these concepts. If a caller strays too far from the domain of concepts that has been established by the algorithm, a static sound is produced and the call is dropped. This allows the show to maintain a cohesive feel.
