He usually wears a jumpsuit and a tie, and he loves to tell vegetable jokes. In fact, we once won ten thousand dollars with a vegetable joke submission to <a href="{{ link:aba13870-5297-4624-aab2-82a5e48c9e8d }}">Blythe Magazine</a>.</p><p>He has a large chalkboard in his office and if someone is in violation of building codes, he writes their name on it and cuts off the electricity to their business, until they stop by to erase their names.</p>'
