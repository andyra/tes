Blaine Yenna is part owner of the [Rain Room Motel] with his wife, Nadine. He does the odd jobs, like keeping the rain circulatory units running and picking up wet towels from around the pool and weeding the beds and the flowerbeds. He’s a nuclear cosmologist but he never found a job doing anything like that, so instead he opened the motel with his wife.
