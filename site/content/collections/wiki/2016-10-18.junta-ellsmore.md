Junta Ellsmore is a spiritualist who believes that we are wading through a spiritual soup and the only way we can survive this supernatural broth is to fashion our clothing and automobiles in a way that least disturbs the otherworld. For this reason, he opened up a shop in [The Adobe Skyscraper], [Tread Lightly]. Although Junta uses all of these products, he is still often quite nervous about disturbing the spiritual world.
