    text: '<p>Junta Ellsmore is a spiritualist who believes that we are wading through a spiritual soup and the only way we can survive this supernatural broth is to fashion our clothing and automobiles in a way that least disturbs the otherworld. For this reason, he opened up a shop in <a href="{{ link:5d2b95f8-0372-4557-a97c-c3c40d7a2f9e }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>, <a href="{{ link:579fa632-e74f-4c00-a6b9-da5af183a731 }}">Tread Lightly</a>. Although Junta uses all of these products, he is still often quite nervous about disturbing the spiritual world.</p>'
