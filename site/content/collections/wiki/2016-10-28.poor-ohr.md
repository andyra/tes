    text: '<p>There was a wildly popular cartoon in the 40’s called Poor Ohr about a relief pitcher named Bo Ohr who inevitably always lost the game in the end. There was a spectator who sat in the outfield seats, who ate ice cream all game long and always exclaimed “Poor Ohr! He’s gonna lose the game AGAIN!”</p>'
