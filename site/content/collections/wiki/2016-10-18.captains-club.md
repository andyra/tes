The Captain’s Club is a members-only club in [The Adobe Skyscraper] that caters to business owners and important people. It offers a location to get away from the hustle and bustle of the business world and have a nice [Raquettea] or conversation. It is operated by [Cindy Captain], who, due to the nature of her job, is the most informed person in the Adobe Skyscraper. She knows all the going’s on because people speak freely at the Captain’s Club, and they get a good view of the city. At one point there was a sitcom about The Captain’s Club. It was very popular for six years.
