Gorami Mountain is a mountain southeast of [Adobe Skyscraper]. It is a geological oddity in that is is comprised of a few very steep peaks surrounded by a very deep rift. So, measured from its base to its peak, it is one of the tallest mountains in the world. Its upper slopes are snow-covered year-round and their steepness makes them prime location for skiing. In fact, two of the most accomplished skiers in the world, [Sue Ellen Farmsadd] and [Gretch Zbarkl] constantly practice their art on the triple black diamond slopes of upper Gorami Mountain.

Gorami Mountain is also the historic dwelling place of a sect of ascetics the [Monks of Amiray], who dwell therein.
