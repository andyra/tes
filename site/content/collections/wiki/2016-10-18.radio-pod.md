    text: '<p>Radio pods are satellites in lower orbit that broadcast radio signals, in an effort to escape licensing and regulation of airwave broadcasts. They typically can sustain crews of around 20 and are connected to the ground by long radio ropes, on which elevator pods shuttle crews, equipment and gravity stores. They are often occupied by <a href="{{ link:27d626e1-a49e-4a12-8906-5b72fcd655ca }}">hobos</a> after hours, who use their broadcasting capabilities to communicate what they call "community building" messages to other hobos.</p>'
