Gabreel's Friendship Gang (often called "The Friendship Gang") is a group of [hobos] who indoctrinate new members by befriending them, getting to know them over the course of a year, and then breaking one of their windows, thus illustrating the meaningless nature of possession. It's namesake is [Marshall Gabreel].
