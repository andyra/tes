A Hobo is a member of a counter-culture movement started in 1962 by [Marshall Gabreel]. They espouse ideals such as living off of the land, caring for stray animals, sleeping in trees, and hijacking [radio pods] for late night broadcasts.

Most hobos keep a vow of celibacy, with their one exception being [Moon Base Madame], which is generally a hypothetical exception.
