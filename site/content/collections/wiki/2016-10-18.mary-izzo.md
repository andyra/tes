Mary Izzo owns and operates the [Dengue Gift Shop] in the lobby of [The Adobe Skyscraper]. She has, over the course of her career, traveled the globe collecting gift shop items, which she then meticulously replicates by hand, and sells in her shop. She is a master craftsperson and can work in any gift shop medium, such as wood, obsidian, and glow-plastic.
