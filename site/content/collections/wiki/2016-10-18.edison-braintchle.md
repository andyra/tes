    text: '<p>Edison Braintchle (pronounced brain-tick-ly) is the owner and operator of <a href="{{ link:453b2861-436d-4a28-994a-6b4438ea88e0 }}">Formally Casual</a>, located in <a href="{{ link:453b2861-436d-4a28-994a-6b4438ea88e0 }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>. He worked for many years in <a href="{{ link:3e664a00-7574-44aa-970b-fff26a06d4f4 }}">Monorail City</a> as a programmer before meeting his wife, <a href="{{ link:212b467c-3ee0-496a-bcb8-0acf3ad72eb5 }}">Marisol Rouza</a>, on a cruise. It so happens that this cruise was a prize he was awarded for winning runner-up in a local art competition and was subsequently highjacked by <a href="{{ link:90bf455a-00d2-4911-bef1-17f797c7e5f7 }}">Novice Coast</a> activists.</p><p>During this cruise, he was also knocked overboard in an attempted burglary, and he claims to have witnessed an elusive aquatic phenomenon. Much of his free time is spent writing the screenplay for a recounting of this experience entitled <a href="{{ link:f3d074b2-919c-4a93-8ebf-adf1dfb04248 }}"><em>Edison Braintchle and the Fishmonster</em></a>.</p>'
