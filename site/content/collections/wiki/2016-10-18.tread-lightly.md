Tread Lightly is a shop in [The Adobe Skyscraper] that specializes in clothing and apparatuses specific for allowing the user to least infringe on the unseen spiritual world that theoretically envelopes us. It is owned and operated by [Junta Ellsmore], a prominent "soup spiritualist." Among the products available for purchase are spiritual fins for cars and vans, soft shoes for sleeping souls, and spirit-friendly hair jelly.
