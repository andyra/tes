An indoor mall built in 1970, unique both for the fact that it has seasons that inversely mirror the seasons in the surrounding area. During summer, for instance, the mall will oftentimes require snow plowing. This is usually carried out by the "Mall Moles," volunteer cleaners who are also known as "The People in Purple" since they wear purple baseball caps.

It is also known for its vast underground floorspace where the biweekly Dog Games commence.
