A _Del Santo knife_ is a knife that is used primarily in life-threatening situations. It is traditionally made out of obsidian and whalebone. Originally it was referred to as a "Ghetti Knife" because it could get you away from a [ghetti]. It became known as a Del Santo knife after [Ed Del Santo] used one to escape from a killer whale and the story became wildly popular.
