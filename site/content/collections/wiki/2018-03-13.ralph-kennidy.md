    text: '<p>Ralph Kennidy was a boy who tragically sat down to read at the base of a <a href="{{ link:2de2f4c2-c1e2-4d0a-92d3-dd23eca9fd88 }}">bongalo tree</a>, which grew rapidly up into his back, through his ribs and around his spine. His skeleton is suspended on the front of that selfsame tree, a cautionary image and tourist attraction.&nbsp;</p>'
