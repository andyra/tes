GEAP is an acronym for “**G**eneral **E**nhanced **A**ction **P**roduct. The first Geap was invented in 1889 and was a platform with four wheels that was essentially the forerunner to the modern automobile. Although GEAP Corp. officially enunciates each of the letters in their brand (G-E-A-P), it is standard in common parlance to pronounce the acronym as a single word, i.e. “Geap.”

## Geaps in popular culture

[King James] is rumored to have enjoyed the pleasure of making out in a Geap. Given the approximate time frame of when he lived, it is unlikely that he would have done so in anything newer than a Geap Grand Bingo.

The [Geap Fireshow] is a popular destination for families attending the quadrennial [Fair of the Universe] in [Sohndu Bay], “The Greatest Geap Show of Them All.”
