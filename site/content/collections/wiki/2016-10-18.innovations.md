Innovations is a science and technology course taught by [Emma Petrovic] at [Crater Lake High School] in [Adobe Skyscraper]. It involves the students' designing seemingly impossible research and technology projects to be completed over the course of a school year. The projects, which are almost always entirely unsuccessful, are displayed at the annual [Grade Scholastic Techno-Science Fair]. Ms. Petrovic argues that the point of the course is not to successfully complete the proposed project (though that is the only way to pass) but to work on impossible problem solving skills.
