A brand of coffee launched by [Yohan Pope] that contains a significant amount of [Timothy Grass], which is known to have hallucinagenic properties.

## In popular culture

The brand has become symbolic to many counterculter youths, including [Skateboard Patrol] exiles who stick patches of Yohan Pope's face on the bookbags and use "Pope" as verb to describe the act of drinking the coffee, as in "Do y'all want to pope with I" or "She was pope-ing when the bus arrived," etc.
