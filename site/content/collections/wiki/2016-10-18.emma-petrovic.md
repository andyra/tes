Emma Petrovic teaches Innovations at [Crater Lake High School]. She received her masters in Science and Technology at [Adobe College of the Desert] before leaving [Adobe Skyscraper] to work abroad.

For many years she was living on a commune in [Bazzis], until she got tired of all the fleas and wet blankets. She works as a waitress occasionally for the fun of it, and likes to mix up peopleâ€™s orders because of fake reasons.
