He also hustles on the side by providing cut-rate "food" and supplies at many of the school cafeterias in town. His specialty is barely edible sandwiches with construction paper cheese, rubber baloney, and panscrape pancake.</p><p>He is also notorious for knocking people down in the parking lot and quickly scooping up the loose change that was dropped.&nbsp;</p>'
