Matt Slime is the owner and proprietor of [Matt Slime Deli]. He also hustles on the side by providing cut-rate "food" and supplies at many of the school cafeterias in town. His specialty is barely edible sandwiches with construction paper cheese, rubber baloney, and panscrape pancake.

He is also notorious for knocking people down in the parking lot and quickly scooping up the loose change that was dropped.
