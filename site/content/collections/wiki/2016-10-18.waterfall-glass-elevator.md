The waterfall glass elevator is the flagship elevator in [The Adobe Skyscraper]. It was designed by [Frostwell Tchai] and is completely hydro-powered. The water falls from the 64th floor and turns four large turbines beneath the lobby, which in turn power both the motors for running the elevators and the motors responsible for operating the swinging bridges that reach out to the elevators. The water is wicked back up to the 64th floor via capillary action through millions of micron-sized tubes. The water must stay extremely clean and is constantly being filtered and mixed with surfactant to keep the capillaries free from frictional debris. This is the task of the waterfall technician, [Zaso Jacquzi].
