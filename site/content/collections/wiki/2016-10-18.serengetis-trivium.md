The Serengetis Trivium, or "sports tree," is a species of willow that produces sporting-good shaped fruit and buds. It was originally believed that this species was an anomaly among the botanical circles, until a forest was discovered in southeastern [Moktavia]. There is a common misconception that the tree produces fruit that resembles sporting good equipment, when in reality the majority of sporting good equipment is based upon the utilization of the serengetis' fruit and branches. It has been referred to as the "birth tree of all sport."
