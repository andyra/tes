He decided to open the daycare when he was on a late-nite television show and the host made a wise crack about his last name. While he doesnâ€™t directly work with the kids in the daycare, he does help to direct the annual Dadz Doodz musical, which is performed in the lobby of the skyscraper every May 14th.</p><p>Chuck likes to exclusively wear slippers, so that he can never be accused of stomping too loudly and waking a sleeping child.</p>'
