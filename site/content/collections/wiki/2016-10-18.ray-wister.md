    text: '<p>Ray Wister (born Raymond Hannible Avondale Wister) is the Producer and main talent scout at&nbsp;<a href="{{ link:f11e7dfe-76ab-446f-a48f-74d1927be263 }}">F.C. Telco</a>. He is also in charge of booking and can often be found staying up late through the night in the Mails &amp; Distributions Department of <a href="{{ link:5d2b95f8-0372-4557-a97c-c3c40d7a2f9e }}">The Adobe Skyscraper</a>, sending out letters and packages.</p><p>Before working in the studio, Ray was a support operator and occasional on-call emergency technician. He was commended with a paper certificate in 1987 for being the “unhealthiest person in the room.”</p><p>In 1988, after a lightning storm knocked down many of the telephone poles across the city, the support office became swamped with phone calls from angry customers. He famously shut down support operations within a day so he didn''t have to deal with what he called “all that.” He is well known for having transformed the entire support office into a recording studio, F. C. Telco, which he sold to <a href="{{ link:84f21787-8ae1-4668-85f5-57b2cdde150b }}">Lmo Kodak</a> in 1990.</p><h2>Love Life</h2><p>None.</p>'
