Ray Wister (born Raymond Hannible Avondale Wister) is the Producer and main talent scout at the [Fertile Crescent Telephone Company]. He is also in charge of booking and can often be found staying up late through the night in the Mails & Distributions Department of [The Adobe Skyscraper], sending out letters and packages.

Before working in the studio, Ray was a support operator and occasional on-call emergency technician. He was commended with a paper certificate in 1987 for being the “unhealthiest person in the room.”

In 1988, after a lightning storm knocked down many of the telephone poles across the city, the support office became swamped with phone calls from angry customers. He famously shut down support operations within a day so he didn't have to deal with what he called “all that.” He is well known for having transformed the entire support office into a recording studio, F. C. Telco, which he sold to [Lmo Kodak] in 1990.
