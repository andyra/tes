title: Overboard
notes: 'It takes a long, long time for the light from stars to go a long, long way and get where we are. But most of us don’t think or care ‘bout what goes on way up there. We sit outside on patios with tiki lamps and summer clothes. The constellations will slowly die but for all we know they’re still alright. We sip our drinks and we watch Orion shine. When we do, we’re looking way, way back into time. Every thing that you know; every care that you hold- they will fade in a chord when you finally fall overboard. If peace could swim it’d be a manatee that God produced so pure and free. But with this thing we don’t agree and so they die quite easily and commonly and frequently. They never see the motorboat a-coming. Coming from above! If I know anything it’s that life is a rip tide that will pull you and me out where we cannot hide.'
