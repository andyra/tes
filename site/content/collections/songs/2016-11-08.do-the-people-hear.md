title: 'Do the People Hear?'
notes: '…to me? Do the people hear...? Do they listen…to me? And he said, “Why? Why were you here today? You, the blacksmiths and you, the forest workers and you, the longshoremen, and you; those who look and wonder why you’re still here today? And all of the ones down below the bleachers and those cutting pieces of paper in the alleys; and you, the telephone workmen, and you, the insurance salespersons, and you, the farmers of the plants; why? Why are you here today? Why?” I used to have a gold mine. I used to have a word mine. I used to have a thought mine. Now it’s gutted.'
