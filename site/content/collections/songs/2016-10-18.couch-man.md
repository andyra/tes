title: 'Couch Man'
notes: 'Couch Man sitting there on the lobby sofa. Look at him and he’ll look at you. Couch Man sleeping there on the lobby sofa. Sitting up in his fancy suit. Couch Man sitting there ‘cause he’s always here. Ask him what and he’ll tell you why. Couch Man helping out all who wander in to learn about the adobe sky (scraper). Couch Man- on the couch everyday. Couch Man- never leaves, always stays. Couch Man- ask him what, ask him why. Couch Man- knows about Adobe Sky. Couch Man at the potato chip festival. He has tried almost every kind. Couch Man fixing up your vending machine. Any brand and at any time!'
