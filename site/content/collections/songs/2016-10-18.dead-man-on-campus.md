title: 'Dead Man on Campus'
notes: 'There’s a dead man in the xxxxx at the xxxxx- what do you do? There’s a dead man at the xxxxx of the xxxxxx- what do you do? Just say “shoe”. That was my best table you broke with your dead body. Wake up, dead man. Ethanol’s safe... safer than water, safer than soda, safer than milk. Ethanol’s safe- safer than orange juice, safer than wheatgrass, safer than love. There’s a dead man on the xxxxx at the xxxxx- what do you do? Just leave him there. Dead man on campus...'
