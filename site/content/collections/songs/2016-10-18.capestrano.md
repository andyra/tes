title: Capestrano
notes: 'M. Capestrano... does what he wants to do. Does what he does. And if you feel the hatefulness of boredom, a stone throw’s power to affect the environment’s a reason- don’t fret. M. Capestrano... And if you want to impress your presence, go with sound and the walls and tables will express your waves like a phonogram. So, Bobby, did you learn your digs? One plus twenty... less than it is. So, Bobby, tell me, son, did you learn your digits? One more than twenty-one is no more than it is.  M. Capestrano... does what he does... We did what we did so we could do what we did. M. Capstrano...'
