title: 'Birds in Space'
notes: 'I can tell you this is music (I swear). Why do you think we’re acting so natural? I have seen you standing halfway naked. Why are people looking at us that way? Birds are destructive. Rarely productive. Birds get ideas that put them in bad places. Birds don’t drink alcohol unless it’s available. Birds- yes, we’re birds, but we’re birds in space. Birds are eclectic. Sometimes electric. Classified borderline genius/insane. Birds don’t drink alcohol unless it’s available. Birds- yes, we’re birds, but we’re birds in space.'
