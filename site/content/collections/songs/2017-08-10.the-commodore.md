title: 'The Commodore'
notes: |
  In a world of constant tragedy, the Commodore is your friend. He will keep you comforted with the messages that he sends. Are you keeping up with the Commodore? Because the Commodore is keeping up with you... Are you keeping up? ‘Cause the Commodore is keeping up with you... In a world of constant pageantry, where everything’s on display, it’s nice to see the Commodore every fourth Saturday.
