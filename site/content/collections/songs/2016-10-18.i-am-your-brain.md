title: 'I Am Your Brain'
notes: 'I am your brain and I’ll tell you a story of when you were very young. We used to go down to Anderson harbor and play all day out in the sun. I am your brain and I’ll tell you a story of when you were very young. We used to go down to Cerealtown and get lots of thinking done. Hidden treasure. I am your brain! Hidden treasure. I am your brain and I’ll tell you a story of when you were very young. We used to go down to Anderson harbor and lay all day out in the sun. I used to tie your shoes when you were very young. I used to tie your tongue. Now I just tie your stomach into little knots when you do something dumb. Hidden treasure. I am your brain!'
