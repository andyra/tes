title: 'Postcard Photographer'
notes: 'It’s 2:05 in the afternoon. I’m half dead and trying to jump rope. But it only hurts my bare feet- who didn’t sweep the driveway off? And if I could find the words, I’d say, “Oh, I love you so!” But I don’t know if I do, and that’s a bad way to live. It’s finally gone- the summer sun. That time of year- trade your fantasies for fantasies of fear. Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus. Can’t explain, or I don’t want to. Believe me- it’s modern science. Courtroom stenographer. Hack oceanographer. Postcard photographer. Tell me who you are. And if you look around the room, you might see a spiritual force. Might see something that’s ready to break through the bathroom window. Gas chromatographer. Roman biographer. Lunar cartographer. Tell me who you are. Postcard photographer- that is who you are.'
