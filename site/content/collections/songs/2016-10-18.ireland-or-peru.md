title: 'Ireland or Peru'
notes: 'So I’m going to Ireland or Peru. There’s so many greens and blues. Seems like a good thing to do and no one in their right mind is gonna try and stop me now. I see you’re standing strong, please break that smile and spread it all over me…So I’m gonna go find the silver and the gold. Mine’s a heart you cannot hold. Just believe everything I told you and no one in their right mind is gonna try and stop me now.'
