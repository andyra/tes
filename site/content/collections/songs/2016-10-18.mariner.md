title: Mariner
notes: 'I am a mariner out on the blazing sea. I can see for miles around me; the mists have left me. And of all the creatures that dwell out on the waves; soon I will know if I’m the greatest, the greatest on the waves. I can see for miles around me; I love to take it in. And I will never forget the day I left, the day I left that sinful port St. Augustire. I love the sea; I love the foaming fire. I am the Mariner…Out there on the sea I know I’m not alone for I am surrounded by waves of fire. The clouds come down to say their own desires.'
