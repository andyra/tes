title: 'You Don’t Do That'
notes: 'You don’t do that. You don’t do that. You don’t sleep in court when they are trying someone. You don’t do that, especially if they’re trying you. You don’t do that. You don’t do that. You don’t mess with a dog when it’s doing its business. You don’t do that. If it’s a big dog, you don’t do that. You don’t do that. You don’t smoke a cigarette in someone’s shower. You don’t do that, unless it’s your shower. You don’t do that. You don’t do that. You don’t do that…'
