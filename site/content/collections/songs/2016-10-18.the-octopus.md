title: 'The Octopus'
notes: 'What do you want from me? I live so casually. I don’t have anything to offer you. I’ve got a lot of debt. I’ve got a fishing net. I caught a little pet I named Drew. Me and Drew go way back to the beginning, when we both were young and maybe before. People think that he is very frightening- a Portuguese Man ‘o War. Where do we go from here? Full of hope, full of fear. I’ve spent too many years in this factory. You know your multiplication. You multiplied your heart by a thousand. Multiply your brain by the same and then talk to me. Me and you go way back to the beginning, when we both were young and maybe before. Why do you think this is so, so frightening? Don’t worry anymore. I am Jonah, I bring flowers. I don’t disagree. I am Peter; I bring happiness to those by the sea. I am Walter; I don’t really care if you know me. I won’t tear you apart, but I will make your name a memory. I am Michael, I bring sunshine. You all want me there. I am Marcos, I bring windows. I deliver here. But what can you say when your life is away and the people that you love so dearly? What can you do when the octopus finds you sleeping? Aaaaa!'
