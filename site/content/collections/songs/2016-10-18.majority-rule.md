title: 'Majority Rule'
notes: 'Everything you see in the world can be summed up by thoughts that you convert into words- who runs the show? Who runs your life? If you knew then you’d know. If you knew you’d be right. It’s majority rule (NWO). Majority rule. It’s majority rule (NWO). Majority rule. Everywhere you go in your life can be summed up by journeys that you take in your mind. Who plans the routes? Who plans your life? If you knew it’d be moot. If you knew, you’d be right. It’s majority rule (NWO). Majority rule. It’s majority rule (NWO). Majority rule.'
