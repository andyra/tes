Dead animal collection. Is it a verb? Is it a noun? A service or an obsession? Dead animal collection. Platypus... Platypus is the strangest thing, now what is that supposed to prove? Platypus... Platypus got’s poisonous feet now what are we supposed to do? Can you see how the falcon dives in the deep blue sea, as he’s very prone to do? And oftentimes the dolphins rise and snatch men right off of the shore- it’s the best they can do.'
