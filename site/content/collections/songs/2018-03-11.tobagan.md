title: Tobagan
notes: 'Would God make a fish who’d never be lonely? Never get sad when left on its own? Day after day, living alone; He did and its name’s Tobagan (Tobagan) Tobagan (Tobagan) Tobagan. Would God make a fish who’d always be happy? Always content when left on its own. Night after night, swimming alone. He did and its name’s Tobagan (Tobagan) Tobagan (Tobagan) Tobagan.'
