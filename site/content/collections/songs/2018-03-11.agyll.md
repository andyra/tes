title: Agyll
notes: 'My name is Agll; this is my way to say, “Get out of my way,” today. This is all I say on the deserted beach; the desert filled with dry. And this is where I’ve been since I can’t think of any other place that I have been in any recent time to matter. And here the nights are long and cold but the days are inextinguishably hot. And the memory keeps flapping around in my head all this time like something that I will mention it not. So maybe by now you see where I am going with this. Why did you have to go? Now I’m left all alone. And I will never know just why you chose to go. And I wouldn’t lie but just don’t try to give it to the way that I would have it not. With sickening sorrow I think of your face. I yell in anguish when I remember your graceful walking down a waterfall, until I fall down the way. This is what I say, this is the way, don’t make me fall, and that’s not all that I have to say. I’d love to run across the desert or run across the snow. I’d love to tear the things apart that make me move so slow but this is just a crazy dream that never will be real; so’s the rest of my life. My name is Agll.'
