title: 'Please Feel Free'
notes: 'Ever since you left me (please feel free to sing in) I didn’t feel so good. (He doesn’t feel so good). I didn’t think that I would. (He doesn’t feel so good). You broke my heart. You broke my heart. Oh, you; every since we got through I’ve been a mess, it’s true. (He is a mess it’s true). I’ve been untying my shoes. (He is a mess it’s true). You broke my heart. You broke my heart. The sex and drugs and lies and hate and all the little things that a relationship will instigate. Oh, you; ever since we got screwed, though it was you, not us. (He says you screwed yourself). I didn’t make a fuss. (He says you screwed yourselves). You broke my heart. You broke my heart.'
