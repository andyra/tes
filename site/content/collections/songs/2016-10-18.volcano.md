title: Volcano
notes: 'I had a dream I fell into a volcano- a stratocone volcano. My feet were stuck in mud but it was not mud- it was a’a’ lava. On top a volcano sometimes there’s water- that’s a crater lake. Crater lake... I know I can’t swim and I can’t breathe underwater. I’m just a pyroclastic flow blowing out a volcano- a pyroclastic flow. I had a dream I melted an iceberg- a really damn big iceberg. It flooded the world and made a really bad mudslide- it was worse than Moses. One thing left untouched was crater lake. It was crater lake.'
